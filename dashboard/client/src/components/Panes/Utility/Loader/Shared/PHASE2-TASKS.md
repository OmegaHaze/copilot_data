# Phase 2 Consolidation Tasks

This document outlines the specific tasks that need to be completed in Phase 2 of the Module-Component consolidation process. It provides a roadmap for developers to continue the consolidation work.

## 1. Fixing Circular Dependencies

### High Priority

- [ ] **Component Registry ↔️ Module Core**
  - Problem: component-registry.js and module-core.js import from each other
  - Solution: Extract shared interfaces to break the dependency cycle
  - Files to modify:
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Component/component-registry.js`
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Module/module-core.js`

- [ ] **Component Core ↔️ Shared Utilities**
  - Problem: Potential circular references between utility functions
  - Solution: Complete the migration to shared-utilities.js
  - Files to modify:
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Component/component-core.jsx`
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Shared/shared-utilities.js`

## 2. Updating References to Use Canonical Sources

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Update Storage Function References**
  - Replace all references to storage functions in module-operations.js with imports from module-storage.js
  - Files to check:
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Session/session-manager.js`
    - `/components/Dashboard/dashboard-reducer.js`
    - `/components/Dashboard/dashboard-actions.js`

- [ ] **Update Constants References**
  - Replace all imports of constants from module-constants.js with imports from component-constants.js
  - Files to check:
    - All files that import from module-constants.js (use grep to find them)

## 3. Cleanup Tasks

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Remove Duplicate Functions**
  - Once all references are updated, remove the duplicate functions
  - Files to modify:
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Module/module-operations.js`

- [ ] **Remove Transitional Files**
  - Once all imports are updated, remove transitional files
  - Files to consider:
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Module/module-shared.js`
    - `/components/Panes/Utility/Loader/Module/module-constants.js`

## 4. Code Quality Improvements

### Ongoing

- [ ] **Update Tests**
  - Ensure all tests use the canonical implementations
  - Add tests for shared utilities

- [ ] **Improve Documentation**
  - Add JSDoc comments to all shared utility functions
  - Update README files to reflect the current state of the consolidation

## 5. Technical Debt To Address

- [ ] **Module Configuration Source of Truth**
  - Standardize on component registry as the source of truth for module configuration
  - Remove remaining references to module-specific configuration

- [ ] **Storage Function Consolidation**
  - Consider creating a unified storage API that handles both module and component storage
