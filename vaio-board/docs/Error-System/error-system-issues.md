# Error System Issues and Solutions

## Key Issues Identified

After thorough analysis of both frontend and backend error handling, here are the key issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Frontend Issues

#### Global Window Object ✓ (RESOLVED May 4, 2025)
- ~~**Issue**: `window.__VAIO_ERROR_SYSTEM__` is used to expose error functions globally.~~
- ~~**Impact**: Creates tight coupling and makes testing difficult.~~
- ~~**Solution**: Remove global registration and use React Context or direct imports.~~
- **Resolution**: Implemented a modular errorHandler utility with direct imports. All references to `window.__VAIO_ERROR_SYSTEM__` have been replaced.

#### Console Error Overrides
- **Issue**: Console methods are overridden in `main.jsx` to capture all errors.
- **Impact**: May catch irrelevant errors and create noise in the error system.
- **Solution**: Replace with more targeted error boundary components and explicit error reporting.

#### Error State Management
- **Issue**: Both global error store and local component error states are used.
- **Impact**: Leads to inconsistent error handling and duplicate state.
- **Solution**: Standardize on Zustand store for all error state management.

#### Error Type Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error types and categorization across components.
- **Impact**: Makes error filtering and prioritization difficult.
- **Solution**: Implement standardized error types and severity levels.

### 2. Backend Issues

#### Limited Error Structure
- **Issue**: Backend error logs lack structured format for frontend consumption.
- **Impact**: Frontend can't easily categorize or filter backend errors.
- **Solution**: Enhance unified_log_manager to provide structured error data.

#### Missing Integration Points
- **Issue**: Socket error events aren't directly integrated with the frontend error system.
- **Impact**: Socket errors may not appear in the error notification system.
- **Solution**: Update SocketContext to use useError for error reporting.

#### No Error Persistence
- **Issue**: Frontend errors aren't persisted to the backend.
- **Impact**: Error history is lost on page refresh.
- **Solution**: Add API endpoints for storing frontend errors.

### 3. Integration Issues

#### Disconnected Systems
- **Issue**: Frontend and backend error systems operate independently.
- **Impact**: No unified view of system errors.
- **Solution**: Create bidirectional error flow between systems.

#### Inconsistent Error Display
- **Issue**: Errors are displayed in multiple places (notifications, logs, console).
- **Impact**: User confusion and fragmented error experience.
- **Solution**: Implement hierarchical error display based on severity.

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Remove Global Window Object** ✓ (COMPLETED May 4, 2025)
   - ~~Update ComponentRegistry.js to import error functions directly~~
   - ~~Remove window.__VAIO_ERROR_SYSTEM__ registration in ErrorProvider~~

2. **Standardize Error Flow**
   - Ensure all components use useError() hook
   - Update SocketContext.jsx to forward socket errors to error system
   - Create standard error types and severity levels

3. **Integrate Backend Errors**
   - Enhance unified_log_manager to provide structured error data
   - Update SocketContext to properly categorize and display backend errors

4. **Add Error Persistence**
   - Create API endpoints for storing frontend errors
   - Implement error synchronization between frontend and backend

The most critical issue to address first is the global window object, as this creates the most technical debt and makes the system difficult to maintain and test.
