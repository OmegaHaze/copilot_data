# Socket Error Handling Improvements

**Date:** May 4, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to socket error handling in the VAIO Board application as part of the Phase 2 error handling system upgrade. These changes standardize how socket errors are reported, provide better context for debugging, and improve user experience.

## What Was Changed

### 1. SocketContext.jsx Updates

- Added import of error handler and standard error types
- Updated `connect_error` handler to use standardized error reporting
- Modified `disconnect` handler to identify and report unexpected disconnections
- Enhanced `connectToModule` function to properly report socket errors with context
- All socket errors now include component name, action, location, and detailed metadata

### 2. EnvSocketContext.jsx Updates

- Added import of error handler and standard error types
- Updated metrics socket creation error handling
- Improved error reporting for unknown metrics types
- Added detailed context information to socket error reports

### 3. TerminalPane.jsx Updates

- Added import of error handler and standard error types
- Enhanced all socket event handlers to use standardized reporting:
  - `connect_error` event
  - `disconnect` event
  - `error` event
  - `pty_error` event
- Updated input sending error handling
- Added error reporting for terminal event setup failures
- Maintained existing UI feedback while adding global error reporting

### 4. Documentation

- Created a comprehensive socket error handling guide
- Added best practices specific to socket error scenarios
- Included code examples for common socket error patterns

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistent Error Reporting**: All socket errors now use the standardized error system
2. **Better Error Context**: Error reports include more detailed information for debugging
3. **Improved Error Classification**: Socket errors are properly categorized and prioritized
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Error metadata helps identify the root causes of issues
5. **Maintained User Experience**: Local component feedback is preserved alongside global notifications

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify socket error handling across different connection scenarios
2. **Backend Integration**: Enhance backend error reporting to match frontend formats
3. **Error Persistence**: Add mechanisms to store and analyze socket error patterns

These improvements complete the socket error handling portion of the Phase 2 error system upgrade and provide a solid foundation for error handling across the application.
